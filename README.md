## what is the todo list project?
Yes, it is the list of tasks on the peice of paper that we usually use in our real life to not forget to do things and on their time, but we are basically converting the piece of paper to a website so you don't have to spend more paper ðŸ˜‰, also, if you still don't know what a todo list is [see wikipedia](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/to-do_list).

## Instructions

### Collaboration requirements
Please don't split the code. Write every line of code together. In each group, every person should understand every line of code.

### Code
In this project, you will be using HTML, CSS, and JS in order to create a todo list website of your choice.

### Functional requirements
These requirements will basically update each week and you will add to the work you did the previous week so make sure you write clean code, also, this is why you see requirements titled week N.

#### Week 1 requirements
- form with an input field thats required to not be empty for the task title.
- user should be able to select a deadline date for the task which is also a required input.
- make sure the user can't pick a date before today
- user should be able to use the Enter key submit the form.
- button that when clicked performs the action of validating the inputs and adding new task as an object to the list of tasks you have.
- empty the input fields after adding the task to the list.
- you will have a list of items that each item should display the title and deadline date of the task.
- show a text if there is no tasks informing the user about that.

#### Styling requirements
Feel free to use whatever CSS framework or just CSS as long as it looks nice and make sure its responsive too.

PS: you shoudn't spend too much time on styling, the primary goal here is to learn JS and making the style looks absolutely beautiful will waste a good amount of your time
